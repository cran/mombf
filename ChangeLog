- Implemented p>n case in modelSelection
- Changed default to method=='auto' in modelSelection
- Changed default priorCoef, priorModel, priorVar in modelSelection to recommendations in Johnson & Rossell (2010)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.4
- Fixed R CMD CHECK warnings

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.3
- Fixed compiler warnings

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.0
- Added function rnlp to sample from MOM, eMOM and iMOM posteriors under Normal linear models
- Added class msfit and several basic methods
- Added momprior, imomprior, emomprior, modelunifprior, modelbinomprior, modelbbprior, igprior functions to facilitate creating objects of class msPriorSpec
- Prevented numerical overflow in computing iMOM integrated likelihood with method=='Hybrid' and method=='MC'. Improves pimomMarginalU and modelSelection for both these methods.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.1
- Fixed bug in modelSelection that caused to report the wrong model (only) at the first Gibbs iteration
- Increased precision of Laplace approximation to compute MOM and iMOM integrated likelihood

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0
- Fixed C++ bug in Solaris caused by overloading of 'log' and 'sqrt' functions

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.9
- Fixed C++ bug in Solaris caused by overloading of 'pow' function
- Limited number of saved models by modelSelection Gibbs scheme when p>16, to avoid running out of memory

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.8
- modelSelection Gibbs scheme now uses saved log(integrated likelihood) + log(prior) for previously considered models. Observed a 5-10 fold increase in speed.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.6
- Added truncated multivariate normal random number generation routines

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.5
- Increased precision in pimom marginal Laplace approximation, which could cause crashing due to non-positive definitiness 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4
- Fixed code chunks in vignette to enhance their visibility

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
- Added check to T dmom to ensure that prior is proper
- Added greedy initialization algorithm for probit models
- Added multivariate version of heavy-tailed pMOM to dmom
- Modified heavy-tailed eMOM implemented in dmom so that it is consistent with heavy-tailed pMOM. Now both are defined via hyper-priors on tau.
- Added pplPM function
- Added emomLM, emomPM function

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1
- modelSelection now returns the estimated regression coefficients for the most probable model

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0

- Product MOM and iMOM priors now implemented
- Linear model variable selection for MOM and iMOM priors implemented

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.5
